For response messages, whether or not a message-body is included with a message is dependent on both the request
method and the response status code (section 6.1.1). All responses to the HEAD request method MUST NOT
include a message-body, even though the presence of entity-header fields might lead one to believe they do. All 1xx
(informational), 204 (no content), and 304 (not modified) responses MUST NOT include a message-body. All other
responses do include a message-body, although it MAY be of zero length
